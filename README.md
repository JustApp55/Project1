   How The Game Is Played

A player puts in a number between 1 and 99. 
The guess number will be compared to the randomly generated number
If the guess number is greater than the random number, the player will receive this response;  
   "Too high + guess number + try again."
If the guess number is less than the random number, the player will receive this response; 
   "Too low  + guess number + try again."
If the guess number is  equal to the random number, the player will receive this response; 
   "Yay! Correct.  You Smartie Pants!"
