Number Guessor game

   ## How The Game Is Played
- A player puts in a number between 1 and 99. 
- The guess number will be compared to the randomly generated number
- If the guess number is greater than the random number, the player will    
  receive this response;  "Too high + guess number + try again."

- If the guess number is less than the random number, the player will 
  receive this response; "Too low  + guess number + try again."
- If the guess number is  equal to the random number, the player will 
  receive this response; "Yay! Correct.  You Smartie Pants!"
